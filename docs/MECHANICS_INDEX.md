# Shandalar Mechanics Index (v1.0)

## Overview

This document maps every gameplay mechanic in Shandalar to:

1. Design intent (GDD.md)
2. Mechanical definition (SYSTEMS.md)
3. Implementation (actual code in /src)
4. System ownership (authoritative engine boundary)

This is the **traceability layer of the entire architecture**.

It ensures:
- no orphan mechanics
- no hidden logic
- no duplicate system ownership
- no UI-driven rule drift

# 9. SYSTEM DEPENDENCY GRAPH

---

## 9.1 Core Dependencies

- DuelCore → rulesets, keywords, cards
- AI → DuelCore state snapshots
- MapGenerator → rngSeed system
- UI → useDuel only

---

## 9.2 Global Dependency

- rngSeed → ALL systems

---

# 10. SYSTEM OWNERSHIP MODEL

---

## 10.1 Absolute Authority

- DuelCore.js is the ONLY system that may mutate GameState

---

## 10.2 Decision Authority

- AI.js may only generate GameActions

---

## 10.3 Data Authority

- cards.js, keywords.js, rulesets.js are immutable definitions

---

## 10.4 Presentation Authority

- UI layer is strictly render + input only

---

# 11. ANTI-DRIFT RULES

---

The following are strictly forbidden:

### Outside DuelCore:
- GameState mutation
- turn progression
- combat resolution
- stack execution

### Inside AI:
- rule enforcement
- outcome simulation
- state mutation

### Inside UI:
- gameplay logic execution
- deterministic resolution

---

# 12. COMPLETENESS RULE

A mechanic is considered fully integrated ONLY if:

✔ Defined in GDD.md  
✔ Defined in SYSTEMS.md  
✔ Mapped here in MECHANICS_INDEX.md  
✔ Implemented in /src  
✔ Owned by exactly ONE system
